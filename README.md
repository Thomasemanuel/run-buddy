Run Buddy exercise

The lesson calls for the following command lines to be entered (Module 1.2.3)
  
        <h1> <a href="/">RUN BUDDY</a> </h1>

  with the href set to "/" when you attempt to navigate to the home page by clicking 'RUN BUDDY' button it opens the C drive if 
  you opened the html locally to a browser. When accessed to the Run Buddy deployed website via: github pages; clicking
  the 'RUN BUDDY'button returns a '404 error'.
  
  I went outside the lessons instructions and troubleshooted the code to work by using the following commands:
  
         <h1> <a href="index.html">RUN BUDDY</a> </h1>
         
  Now when you press the 'RUN BUDDY' button it takes you top the homepage as it should.
